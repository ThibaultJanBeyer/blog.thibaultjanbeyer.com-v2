<p>The task was to create a series of three movie poster. The posters should be for existing movies. We were only allowed to use our own resources. As I wanted to make something funny, I decided to start from a bizarre picture of my cat (Lily) and remake existing movie posters with cat as hero. Try to guess the movie:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-221 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/graphic_lily.png" alt="Graphic Design - Lily as James Bond" width="800" height="1132" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-222 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/graphic_lily2.png" alt="Graphic Design - Lily as Godfather" width="800" height="1132" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-223" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/graphic_lily3.png" alt="Graphic Design - Lily as Aliens from outer space" width="800" height="1132" /><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">I learned that pictures look more realistic if you add a lot of “dust” like the random dots in the tube. The third poster was the most difficult one but also made the most fun. I had to edit some basic typo to create that cool look. I added and color corrected forest pictures. I did the UFOs in Illustrator. Then, colored the pic of the couple (cc). Lastly, adding some “dust” everywhere.</span></p>
