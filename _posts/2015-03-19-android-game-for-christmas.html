<p>My brother and I made that game as Christmas present for our dad. It is a casual android game. You have to tap the heads before they start to sing. If you have too much heads on your screen you lose. For the heads I’ve drawn caricatures of my brother and I. When touched they explode but with hearts instead of blood. For every head, you get +1 on your scoreboard. The game is pretty addictive. <a href="http://blog.thibaultjanbeyer.com/data/stuff/game_christmas.apk" target="_blank">Download the .apk</a> and install it to try it yourself.</p>
