<p>So here we are, tonight I'm leaving Bonn and flying to cape town, south africa. Where I'll spend three-month at <a href="http://friendsofdesign.net/">a SummerSchool</a>. The course is called Print Design &amp; Digital Publishing which includes Layout Design Principles &amp; Techniques, Professional Practice, Finishing Art &amp; Cross media and one LIVE Project (with real clients I guess). I hope that I'll have enough spare time beside the school and the awesome activities I'm planning to keep you up to date about my adventure. Be sure to subscribe!</p>
<p>So first off some piece of information about how to organize such a trip.</p>

<h4>Checklist:</h4>
<p><span class="Unicode">☑</span> Get a travel insurance.<br />
<em> Probably the easiest part: just call your regular insurance</em>.<br />
<span class="Unicode">☑</span> Find an accommodation.<br />
<em> I booked a room via <a href="http://airbnb.de/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AirBnB</a> – Sure, student hostels or dorms may be somewhat cheaper, but you're more likely to hassle with papers, deposit and stuff.</em><br />
<span class="Unicode">☑ Get an international driving licence.</span><br />
<em> Also more tha easy, you can get it within one day from your civil registry office</em>.<br />
<span class="Unicode">☑ Book your Flight.<br />
<em> It took me a while to find a super cheap flight. The best website for cheap flights I found was <a href="http://www.skyscanner.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">skyscanner.com</a>. There might be even better websites out there so if you know one, just write it in the comments. I'm travelling to cape town with the emirates airline.<br />
</em>☑ Get the necessary vaccinations.<br />
<em> This was very time intensive as well. Be sure to visit your favorite doc as soon as possible since some vaccination has to be repeated within a given time range. So don't be too late here. Your doc knows what you have to get. If you want to tell yourself I found the website of the<a href="http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Laenderinformationen/00-SiHi/SuedafrikaSicherheit.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Department for Foreign Affairs</a> to have listed all the vaccinations you might need. Plus extra information about the country and what to consider.</em><br />
☑ Take money in the right currency with you.<br />
<em>Don't take too much with you. A worth of 10-30€ is enough. More could leed to trouble at the boarding gate you could be suspected to contraband</em>.<br />
☑ Pack your travel bags.<br />
<em>Just be sure to be informed about the luggage terms and conditions of your  airline. Be sure to take enough of everything with you: Clothes, Entertainment, Money, Your ID, </em>Electronics, Stuff for swimming, cosmetics, etc.<br />
☑ Kiss your Girlfriend.<br />
</span></p>
<p>You're ready to go!</p>
