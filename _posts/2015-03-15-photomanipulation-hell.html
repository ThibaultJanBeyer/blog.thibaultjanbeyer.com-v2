<p style="text-align: left;">I made this Photomanipulation during my first semester on the <a href="http://designstudium.com/" target="_blank">Cologne Design Academy (KDA)</a>. Our task was to create a composing from different elements in Photoshop with the goal to create a bizarre picture.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.thibaultjanbeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/photo_hell4-e1426433957148.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-126 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/photo_hell4-e1426433957148.jpg" alt="Photomanipulation - Photoart: Hell" width="799" height="765" /></a>I wanted to create something surreal that still seems somehow real. Once I had a clear Idea in Mind I started by taking Pictures from Street view.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I had to combine them manually as we could not use automatic functions like photomerge. So I played around a lot with masks, transformations, cloning, smart-objects, textures, color corrections, lighting, burning, dodge, filter and modes. That way I got a decent composing. Same for street-view photos from wall-street.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I had to remove some people, by using the stamp tool and other helpful tools as well as modes to create a nice looking panorama. Afterward I added earth to combine both as well as elevators leading to the “Hell” by Hieronymus Bosch on every side. Just some wrapping and transformations at the end and voilà.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">would you know that I used 111 different images for this photo-manipulation if I did not told you so?</p>
