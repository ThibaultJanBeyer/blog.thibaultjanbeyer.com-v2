How many sports on the ice do you know? Ice hockey, curling, skating? Yes, you have seen them all and it gets boring! Here comes something new and exiting: Broomball! Broom what? That's the usual question I get. 

## So, what the heck is Broomball?

It is the best sport on ice I've played so far. Let me tell you why you'll love broomball too:

Broomball is very easy to get into. It is easy to learn and you won't have to take a loan to afford the equipment. Broomball is not as freaking expensive as ice hockey. In fact, you'll only need the helmet, the stick and some sport shoes. That makes it even affordable if your a broke college student. 

Broomball is an exiting sport game played on a similar court as in ice hockey. But half as large, for double the thrill. 2 teams of usually 6 players fight for the ball to score as many points as possible. You get points by shooting it into the opponent's goal. The goals have actually the same shape and size as in ice hockey. Both sports also share most of their rules. The rules in broomball are a bit simpler, because the simpler the better.

## Is broomball like hockey? 

Broomball is actually often compared to hockey. If you get asked what is Broomball? The simplest explanation would be: “broomball is like a mashup of hockey and soccer. It takes the best of both worlds and leaves the crap aside”. While broomball has some similarities with ice hockey, it is way better. They might have the same player setup: 1 goalie, 3 forwards, 2 defensemen. Are both played on an ice field and share a similar ruleset. But they also have huge differences:
- You can't skate? Who cares, in broomball you don't use skates. You play it with sport shoes!
- A head-sized ball is used instead of a puck. That makes it easier to follow and better to shoot.
- Players use a stick called broom to control the ball and shoot goals. In the 1900' players used a real broom. Nowadays brooms are more sophisticated. Modern brooms in broomball are wooden or metallic sticks with a broom shaped rubber end.
- Rounds are shorter. Only 18-20 minutes. Because it's much more demanding. That makes it more interesting.
- Checks as in ice hockey are mostly forbidden. But that can vary based on the league and the referees. You want hard-core? You can get hard-core.

By the way, the amount of players can vary too. In some amateur games, I have seen games with as many as 50 players and sometimes as few as 3 on 3. That makes broomball one of the most flexible fun-games.

## What makes broomball special?

Broomball is a very very very speedy game. An official match only consists of two 18-20 minutes half times. If there is need for overtime, it is another 20 minutes but this time without goalies. If there is still no winner, goal shots are played. Moreover, broomball can be played in gender mixed teams. That's a great thing. Women don't have disadvantages over men. The ice kind of equalizes the game for everyone. Actually, women are often faster and more agile. Still, goals shot by women are worth 2 points while goals scored by men 1. Take that. Thus, it can be strategic to put women in attacking positions. But who knows if broomball keeps the mixed philosophy as the sport evolve and get more and more players. 

## Is broomball popular? 

A broomball game is a very intense and fast paced game. It is a terrific way to improve your teamworking skills. While being easy to learn and does not need a lot of upfront costs. No wonder the love for broomball is growing so fast! More and more countries have adopted the sport. There are official broomball headquarters in Canada, USA, Russia, Switzerland, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Italy, Australia and even in Japan! No matter what you do, there will always be Asians bringing it to the next level. Every year new national as well as international tournaments arise. Now, the IFBA is even considering taking broomball to the winter Olympics. 

## Broomball is awesome! 

Broomball has it all: almost no financial entrance barrier, easy to learn, flexible, fast and fun to play. No wonder broomball is becoming so popular. It is quite an exercise, inclusive and even a bit weird. There you have it, the perfect recipe to spice up your mundane life!
