<p>Sparta Ball, filmed in 2008, is one of my earliest works. I made some movies before but this one was my first presentable one. The movie should be considered as art. As my aim was to make art that anyone would understand, the movie has a of plot you can follow. It’s the story of Nico whose favorite ball roll away. As he does not want to lose his precious Sparta Ball, he chase it through strange locations until a thug pics it up and... Well, you'll see. The moral: you should never judge a book by its cover.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
