<p>This was our <em>one day project. </em>We had one day to pick a product with very bad design and redesign it the same day. I took Aros’ orange juice. It is one of the worst packaging designs around. I know people who don’t buy it because of the packaging – even if the taste is alright. The new design should speak for itself. It suggests following keywords: ecologic, nature, homemade, high quality, good, tasty, fruity, 100% recyclable and cheap. I guess their sales would grow drastically if they would redesign their packaging like that.</p>
