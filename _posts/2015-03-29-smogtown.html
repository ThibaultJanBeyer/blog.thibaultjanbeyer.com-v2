<p>This is a campaign against pollution with the aim to raise the "coolness" of bicycles. We created a fictive story about a city that is oppressed by cars. But a crazy professor, willing to save his city, creates a robo-bycicle to fight against the cars. Break. People are invited to vote for the Winner and thus have a chance to win a bike. The aim is to raise awareness and to incite people to use their bicycle instead of their cars. The campaign tries to crush the bad reputation a bicycle has thus showing that using a bicycle is badass. The campaign runs as TV Ad, Facebook Ad and on the streets with those posters:</p>
