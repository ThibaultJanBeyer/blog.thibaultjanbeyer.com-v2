It is one of the oldest towns in Yemen. It was the capital of Yemen from the 13th to the 15th century and a center of the Arab and Muslim world due in large part to its famed University of Zabid and being a center of Islamic education. Today, however, it is at the intellectual and economic margins of modern Yemen.<br />

<strong>Why was it added? </strong>due to the conflict in that area and also<strong> </strong>a planned reservoir that would have partially flooded the site was suspended in the wake of the Iraq War by the new administration; lack of adequate protection.</p>
<h3 id="18" style="text-align: center;">18. <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/227" target="_blank">Comoé National Park</a> (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/qcyrn" target="_blank">map</a>)</h3>

The park was initially added as a World Heritage Site due to the diversity of plant life present around the Comoé River, including pristine patches of tropical rain forest that are usually only found further south. As a well-eroded plain between two large rivers, the land in the area is home to soils and a moisture regime suitable to a richer biodiversity than surrounding areas.<br />
<strong>Why was it added? </strong>Due to poaching, over-grazing of the park by cattle, and absence of management.</p>

Built in 507 AD the statues represented the classic blended style of Gandhara art. It is believed that the upper parts of their faces were made from great wooden masks or casts. Rows of holes that can be seen in photographs were spaces that held wooden pegs that stabilized the outer stucco. They were dynamited and destroyed in March 2001 by the Taliban, on orders from leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, after the Taliban government declared that they were idols.<br />
<strong>Why was it added? </strong>Fragile conservation state due to abandonment, military action and dynamite explosions; causing dangers such as risk of collapse of Buddha niches, further deterioration of cave murals, looting and illicit excavations.</p>

It was the first capital of the Venezuela Province and head of the first bishop founded in South America in 1531. As Neu-Augsburg, it was the first German colony in the Americas. Thanks to the city's history, culture and its well-preserved colonial and republican architecture, "Coro and its port" was designated in 1993 as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, thus becoming the first site in Venezuela to be vested with this title.<br />
<strong>Why was it added? </strong>Damage to a great number of structures due to heavy rain between November 2004 and February 2005 as well as the construction of a new monument, a beach walkway and an entrance gate to the city in the buffer zone which could have considerable impact on the value of the site</p>
