<blockquote>Type: University South Africa<br />
Semester: 5 (2015)<br />
Skills: inDesign</p></blockquote>
<p>This was our project from the first course in South Africa. The course name was “digital Publishing – PDF Animations”. We had to create an animated “How To” in InDesign only and distribute it as PDF. I did a “How to make the perfect burger”. A topic “capetownians” certainly can relate to since the food there is so f*cking delicious! I was not able to add the PDF into the Blog but here it is as video. Enjoy:</p>

<p>Protip #1: I found out that you're able to add multiple animations on one object by putting the object you want to animate into a group with an invisible dummy object. Now you can add an animation to the object and one to the pseudo-group as well. So you can stack an infinite number of animations on one object. Boom you just hacked the shit out of inDesign:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2136" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tutorial-multianimationononeobject.gif" alt="tutorial multi animation on one object – inDesign" width="900" height="656" /></p>
<p>Protip #2: To use an inDesign animation in a PDF you have to save your animation as .swf then create a new document and place the .swf inside with an autoplay, then save the document as interactive PDF. You now have a working animation within a “regular” PDF. You'll find all interactive functionalities under window &gt; interactive.</p>
