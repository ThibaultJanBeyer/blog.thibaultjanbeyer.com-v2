<p>Miguel Endara about himself:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Some call me an interactive designer or just enthusiast. But to be honest, I don't even know what I am. I just think that I'm someone who is thinking non stop. Well the good knew is that I'm hired as a Web-Developer. Now that I know what I am I can go and tell it everybody; Hello, my name is Miguel Endara and I'm a Web-Developer.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>That technique, to draw just with dots with different distance to each other, is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointillism" target="_blank"><strong>Pointillism</strong></a>. It was invented by french painters <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Seurat" target="_blank">Georges Seurat</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Signac" target="_blank">Paul Signac</a> in 1886.</p>
