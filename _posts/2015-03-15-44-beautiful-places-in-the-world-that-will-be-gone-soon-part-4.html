<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portobelo,_Col%C3%B3n" target="_blank"><strong>What are the fortifications of Panama?</strong></a> Portobelo is a port city in Colón Province, Panama, established during the Spanish colonial period. It has a deep natural harbor and was used as a center for silver exporting before the mid-eighteenth century. Today Portobelo is a sleepy city with a population of fewer than 3,000. In 1980 the ruins of the Spanish colonial fortifications, along with nearby Fort San Lorenzo, were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.<br />
<strong>Why were they added?</strong> For environmental factors, lack of maintenance and urban development.</p>

It comprises six locations in the city centre of Liverpool including the Pier Head, Albert Dock and William Brown Street, and includes many of the city's most famous landmarks.

<strong>Why was it added?</strong> In 2012, the site was inscribed Due to the proposed redevelopment of historic docklands known as <a title="Liverpool Waters" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Waters">Liverpool Waters</a>.</p>

The town is the capital of the Timbuktu Region, one of the eight administrative regions of Mali. It had a population of 54,453 in the 2009 census.<br />

<h3 id="36" style="text-align: center;">37. <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1139" target="_blank">Tomb of Askia</a> (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/2A17o" target="_blank">map</a>)</h3>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Askia" target="_blank">What is the Tomb of Askia?</a></strong> The Tomb of Askia, in Gao, Mali, is believed to be the burial place of Askia Mohammad I, one of the Songhai Empire's most prolific emperors. UNESCO describes the tomb as a fine example of the monumental mud-building traditions of the West African Sahel. The complex includes the pyramidal tomb, two mosques, a cemetery and an assembly ground. At 17 metres in height it is the largest pre-colonial architectural monument in the region. It is the first example of an Islamic architectural style that later spread throughout the region.<br />
<strong>Why was it added? </strong>Also because of the Threat by armed conflict.</p>
<h3 id="38" style="text-align: center;">38. <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/21" target="_blank">Ancient City of Aleppo</a> (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/8SdFM" target="_blank">map</a>)</h3>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_City_of_Aleppo" target="_blank">What is the ancient city of Aleppo?</a> </strong>The Old City of Aleppo is the historic city centre of Aleppo, Syria. Many districts of the ancient city remained essentially unchanged since its construction during the 12th to the 16th century. Being subjected to constant invasions and political instability, the inhabitants of the city were forced to build cell-like quarters and districts that were socially and economically independent. Each district was characterized by the religious and ethnic characteristics of its inhabitants. The Old City of Aleppo -composed of the ancient city within the walls and the old cell-like quarters outside the walls- has an approximate area of 350 hectares (3.5 km²) housing more than 120,000 residents. Characterized with its large mansions, narrow alleys, covered souqs and ancient caravanserais, the Ancient City of Aleppo became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986.<br />
<strong>Why was it added? </strong>In February 2014, the opposition groups of the Islamic Front claimed responsibility for destroying a series of major historic buildings in the old city including the justice palace, the Carlton hotel and the old building of the city council.</p>

Bosra's inhabitants are predominantly Muslims. Bosra has an ancient history and during the Roman era it was a prosperous provincial capital. It continued to be administratively important during the Islamic era, but became gradually less prominent during the Ottoman era.

In addition to being one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, Damascus is a major cultural and religious center of the Levant. The Barada River flows through Damascus.

Most villages which date from the 1st to 7th centuries, became abandoned between the 8th and 10th centuries. The settlements feature the well-preserved architectural remains of dwellings, pagan temples, churches, cisterns, bathhouses etc. These ancient settlements cover an area 20–40 km (12–25 mi) wide and some 140 km (87 mi) long. The Massif includes three groups of highlands: the first is the northern group of Mount Simeon and Mount Kurd; the second middle group is the group of Harim Mountains; the third southern group is the group of Zawiya Mountain.<br />
<strong>Why were they added? </strong>Military conflict.</p>

In 2006, the castles of Qal'at Salah El-Din and Krak des Chevaliers was recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The site is owned by the Syrian government.<br />
<strong>Why is it on the list? </strong>As every site in Syria because of the military conflict.</p>

Rennell is the largest raised coral atoll in the world and the area in East Rennell surrounding Lake Tegano contains many endemic species.<br />

It had long been a vital caravan stop for travellers crossing the Syrian desert and was known as the Bride of the Desert. Though the ancient site fell into disuse after the 16th century, it is still known as Tadmor in Arabic. There is a newer town of the same name next to the ruins. The Palmyrenes constructed a series of large-scale monuments containing funerary art such as limestone slabs with human busts representing the deceased.<br />
<strong>Why the heck was it added? </strong>Also because of the military conflict there.</p>
