It took me way too long to write this article even tho’ it was requested multiple times.  
As my final thesis when I was still student, I wrote [a very comprehensive website on Accessibility](https://learn-accessibility.org).  
Today I will walk you through some of the key points on accessibility.

## What you can expect

- I will explain what accessibility is.
- I will explain why accessibility is important for user interfacing tools.
- I will walk you through some of the most important things to consider when you want to build an accessible website.
- I’ll give you material to keep up to date.

Accessibility can be a huge, so for the sake of simplicity I’ll focus on traditional websites and web-development.  
I’ll also not go into full detail on the topics, you’re always welcome to hop over to [learn-accessibility.org](https://learn-accessibility.org) for a more detailed view.

Oh, by the way, I will not use the shortcut *a11y* because if we start writing like that, no o1e w3d u8d a6g. I think you get my point, shortening words by typing the number of characters between the first and last letter of the word is like writing in [brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck). In short *a11y* is not accessible.

## What is accessibility?

Most people when they think of accessibility, think that it’s just about visually impaired users using screen readers. While it is true that this group takes up the most space in information on accessibility but it is much more than just that.
On [learn-accessibility.org](https://learn-accessibility.org/) I did chose to split it up into 4 major groups, Visual, Low Vision and Color, Physical and Audio as well as Cognitive. Which is just a way to structure things really and I’m not sure anymore if that was the best idea since when you want to make a website accessibly, you typically don’t want to make it “just” accessible for one of the groups but for all. Never the less, how the website is structured currently, I would rather recommend reading through the sections as if you were reading a book.

### Visual Accessibility

Visual Accessibility covers every user that is using a screen reader. A screen reader is a tool that reads the content on the computer aloud. There are different types of screen readers, the most popular Screen Readers are JAWS and Zoom Text. This group encounters the most pain points when surfing the web. According to the NFB more than 7.5 million people in the United States are blind or have a significant vision loss. That is approximately twice the population of Los Angeles.
